                            Almost 46 million people are living as slaves globally with the greatest number in India but
                            the highest prevalence of slavery in North Korea, according to the third Global Slavery
                            Index released on Tuesday.

                            The index, by Australia-based human rights group Walk Free Foundation, increased its
                            estimate of people born into servitude, trafficked for sex work, or trapped in debt bondage
                            or forced labor to 45.8 million from 35.8 million in 2014.

                            Andrew Forrest, founder of Walk Free, said the rise of nearly 30 percent was due to better
                            data collection, although he feared the situation was getting worse with global displacement
                            and migration increasing vulnerability to all forms of slavery.

                            Incidences of slavery were found in all 167 countries in the index, with India home to the
                            largest total number with an estimated 18.4 million slaves among its 1.3 billion population.

                            But North Korea ranked as worst in terms of concentration with one in every 20 people - or
                            4.4 percent of its 25 million population - in slavery and its government doing the least to
                            end this with reports of state-sanctioned forced labor.

                            As a result, doctors would preform surgery without anesthesia. Doctors used muscle relaxants
                            on the infants to prevent squirming, essentially paralyzing the babies for the duration of
                            the procedure. How long ago was this? Reports indicate that this continued up until the
                            1980's.

                            Every 40 seconds, a child goes missing or is abducted in the United States. Approximately

                            90 percent of these are children. While most reports of missing or abducted children are
                            resolved within hours, many involve situations where a child goes missing permanently or for
                            an extended period of time. The following are some of the key issues surrounding missing and

                            Refrigerators are magnetic because kids used to die inside them. Before 1956, refrigerators

                            According to Buzzfeed, back in the day so many children were climbing into refrigerators,
                            getting stuck inside, and suffocating to death that the government passed the Refrigerator
                            Safety Act in 1956. Until then, refrigerators could only be opened from an outside latch and
                            were lined with an airtight rubber seal, making it harder for parents to hear their children
                            calling for help. Talk about scary.

                            The new act required manufacturers to make fridge doors openable "easily from the inside."
                            So most companies switched to a magnetic mechanism that allowed doors to stay closed when
                            you wanted them to, but open from the inside with a little push. Interesting side note: To
                            help develop door standards, scientists from the American Academy of Pediatrics even studied
                            the effects of being trapped inside a fridge-like atmosphere on kids.

                            On January 17, 1966, at around 10:30am, a Spanish shrimp fisherman watched a misshapen white
                            parcel fall from the sky… and silently glide towards the Alboran Sea. It had something
                            hanging beneath it, though he couldn't make out what it was. Then it slipped beneath the
                            waves.

                            At the same time, in the nearby fishing village of Palomares, locals looked up at an
                            identical sky and witnessed a very different scene - two giant fireballs, hurtling towards
                            them. Within seconds, the sleepy rural idyll was shattered. Buildings shook. Shrapnel sliced
                            towards the ground. Body parts fell to the earth.


                            A few weeks later, Philip Meyers received a message via a teleprinter - a device that could
                            send and receive primitive emails. At the time, he was working as a bomb disposal officer at
                            the Naval Air Facility Sigonella, in eastern Sicily. He was told that there was a top secret
                            emergency in Spain, and that he must report there within days.

                            people each year.

                            There are approximately five deaths caused by sharks annually, while horses kill about 20
                            people a year and cows kill about 22. Crocodiles gobble up 1,000 people a year. By spreading
                            malaria, mosquitos kill hundreds of thousands more people than sharks do every year. Deer
                            also cause hundreds of deaths, mostly by running out in front of cars.
